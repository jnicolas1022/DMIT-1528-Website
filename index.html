      <h2>Why Salt and Vinegar? </h2>
      <p>Salt and vinegar chips are hit or miss to most fans. If you like to have a few tears or you love the smell of vinegar they are the chips for you. Salt and Vinegar being a chip that is hit or miss to its audience makes it hard to hard for those that dislike their first impression to try it again. This can be the factors of the main ingredients potentially being to strong. With Salt and Vinegar being such a niche chip it seemed appropriate for this smaller category to have more information around it.</p>

      <h2>Tierlist </h2>
      <p>What is a tier list? Well a tier list is a way to distinguish the ranking of the chosen item with assigned school grades, usually in association with video games. With as to why, tier lists although rank the subject matter they associate their grading system with the amount of pros and cons the item has. In this case the brand will have its pros and cons evaluated with the mentioned criteira and shown in relation to its overall pros and cons. So by making a Salt and Vinegar Tier list, we allow that mindset of objectivly better and not directly better.</p>
